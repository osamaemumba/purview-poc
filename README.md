## APIs

Azure Purview account configurations are managed using its REST APIs through the use of two Azure Functions. One is used to create/configure data resources and the other to delete the provisioned resources.

The following APIs are called in the creation/configuration function:

* [Create/Update Data Source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/purview/scanningdataplane/data-sources/create-or-update)
* [Create Scan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/purview/scanningdataplane/scans/create-or-update)
* [Run Scan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/purview/scanningdataplane/scan-result/run-scan)
* [Create Glossary Term](https://atlas.apache.org/api/v2/resource_GlossaryREST.html#resource_GlossaryREST_createGlossaryTerm_POST)

The following APIs are called in the deletion function:

* [Delete Data Source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/purview/scanningdataplane/data-sources/delete)
* [Delete Glossary Term](https://atlas.apache.org/api/v2/resource_GlossaryREST.html#resource_GlossaryREST_deleteGlossaryTerm_DELETE)

## Prerequisites

* Application registration needs to be created to enable authentication against your Azure Active Directory  

**To be provided:**

* The following values are needed when using the OneClick Deployment ARM template:-
    * **Resource Group:** Name of the resource group
    * **Region:** Azure region in which to deploy resources
    * **Data Lake Account Name:** Name of the ADSL2 storage account. This storage account will be created and registered as a data source with Purview account. 
    * **Storage Account Name:** Name of the Blob storage account. This storage account will be created and registered as a data source with Purview account.
    * **New or existing Purview Account:** Whether to create a new account or use an existing one
    * **Purview Account Name:** Name of the Azure Purview Account. In case of new Purview account, give a new name. To use an existing one, enter the name of existing purview account.

In case of a new Purview account or to use an existing Purview account in a different resource group, enter the name of that resource group.
    * **Key Vault Name:** Name of the Azure Key vault. This is used to store Client Secret needed to perform API calls and also information on resources so they can be purged when needed.
    * **Factory Name:** Name for the Azure Data Factory. This Data Factory will be created and load the data into the storage accounts with sample NYC Taxi data.
    * **Aad App Client Id:** Client ID of the Application Registration created in prerequisite
    * **Aad App Client Secret:** Client Secret of the Application Registration created in prerequisite
    * **Location:** Location where the resources will be deployed

## Roles and Access Policies

The following table illustrates the required roles and permissions needed:-

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Feature/Service</th>
            <th>Role Assigned</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan=2>Application Registration</td>
            <td>Purview Data Curator</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Purview Data Source Administrator</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Setup and Configure Purview

The following steps are required for a successful deployment of the QuickStart.

* Create an Application Registration in Azure Active Directory. Which helps in establishing a trust relationship between application and the Microsoft identity platform. Copy the client id and client secret from App registration as shown below:-

</p>

* To give application access to the subscription, in Azure Subscription console, add a role assignment of role `Purview Data Curator` and `Purview Data Source Administrator` to the Service Principal App registration created earlier as shown below:-

* Use the OneClick Deployment button above to start the deployment of resources. Currently it takes ~15 minutes for one complete deployment.

## Troubleshooting

This portion lists solutions to problems one might encounter with Purview OneClick Deployment.

### Common Problems

Here is a list of common problems one might encounter while deploying the template.

* Deployment failed on runDataFactory step
* Deployment failed on triggerConfigurePurviewFunction step

### Solution
In case the deployment failed on both above mentioned steps, this can be caused by the Powershell modules used to run the deployment script.
Make sure that:

* App Registration client ID and client secret passed were correct
* The application service principal has access to roles `Purview Data Curator` and `Purview Data Source Administrator` at subscription level.

If the above requirements are satisfied, rerunning the deployment should resolve this issue.
